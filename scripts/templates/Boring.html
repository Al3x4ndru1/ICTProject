            <h2>What are terms and conditions?</h2>

            <p class="lh-lg">
                General terms and conditions (T&Cs) set out those arrangements, provisions, requirements, rules and specifications which occur in every transaction that a seller makes. Whether goods and services are sold on a standard basis or to specification, standard terms and conditions of sale (or supply) are a core part of most businesses.
                
                Please note that these are different from Website term and conditions.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Why should I use terms and conditions?</h2> 
         
            <p class="lh-lg">   The specific, or unique, aspects of the sale or supply of services (eg, any unique specifications, quantity, delivery dates) are set out in a separate order. Make sure that you protect your business interests with professionally prepared T&Cs.
                
                Standard terms and conditions for the sale of goods or supply of services help to make everyone aware of their rights and obligations from the outset and allow the parties to focus their energy on agreeing on the specifics of a particular order. When it comes to consumers, there is a considerable amount of legislation, aimed at protecting consumers, which must be taken into account when drafting T&Cs.

            <h2>What should be included in standard terms and conditions?</h2>   
                Standard terms and conditions usually cover:
                
                policy on refunds and returns
                
                payment terms of the transaction
                
                what happens if a customer receives damaged/ defective good or service
                
                liability 
                
                delivery policy

            <h2>How do I choose the right terms and conditions?</h2> 
                Choosing the right terms and conditions template will depend on who your customers are, what you are selling and how you are selling (ie online or via a website). When using standard terms and conditions, it's particularly important to make sure you know who you are dealing with and whether they are purchasing for a business or as a consumer. When you are dealing with consumers, your terms and conditions will be more restricted as a result of consumer legislation, such as the Consumer Rights Act. For further information, read Doing business with consumers.
